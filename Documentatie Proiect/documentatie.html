        <h3> 1.1 Purpose and Usage </h3>

        <p> The purpose of this website is to allow you to make appointments, plan your busy schedule and to be informed
            about upcoming meetings.You can see every friend's schedule in one place.
        </p>

        <p> This document was written in order to help people understand the purpose of this website,
            how it was made, what functionalities it has and what services it provides.
        </p>

    <section id="user-interface">
        <h3> 1.2 User Interface </h3>
        <img src="./images/TemplatePage.png" alt="Template Page Calendar app">

        <p> This user interface was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>

        <p> The logos were made in Figma. </p>

        <p>
Color holds power. It can impact our moods, emotions, and behaviors.We used blue as a primary color in the app because it is a color that has long been associated with royalty, art, military, business, and nature. </p>

<p>The primary color is the most common favorite color across cultures, genders, and ages and we used it also because we want to make the customer feel comfortable and at peace right away.

Another reason is because blue seems particularly popular in tech and digital applications.</p>


<p>For the secondary color we choose gray to provide more ways to accent and distinguish our app. In color psychology, gray represents neutrality and balance. Its color meaning likely comes from being the shade between white and black. 

Gray and blue create a really versatile combo and will highlight the logo.</p>
<p>The colors we apply to specific buttons and parts of our page can change the way a customer reacts to our app.</p>
